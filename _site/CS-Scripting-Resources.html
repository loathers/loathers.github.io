          challenge path in KoL. Most of them are meant for 1-day, loop-style
          hardcore runs – that is, minimizing resource use rather than
          turncount. Some are not: a few are meant for two-day, or for speed, or
          for something else entirely. Most of these are written in Typescript,
          which is then compiled into Javascript for use by kolmafia. A few are
          written in ash, which conveniently does not need to be compiled.
        </p>

        <p>
          CS scripts tend to be extraordinarily personal. Because the path
          rewards owning a long tail of marginal IotMs, and each user’s
          <a href="http://cheesellc.com/kol/profile.php?u=captain%20scotch"
            >greenboxen</a
          >
          are slightly different, scripts will often fail for those other than
          their single intended user. Take this as a caveat before attempting to
          run any of these, and expect a few strange failures until you either
          customize the script or match the scripter’s suite of IotM resources.
          If you click on each user’s name, you will arrive at their CC
          Snapshot, demonstrating the # of IOTMs they are personally utilizing
          in the service of their script.

          <strong>bean-hccs</strong> is the mother or grandmother of the
          majority of scripts on this list. It is thorough, efficient, and
          clearly written. The script still has remnants from the ‘mode’ combat
          system that can be found in bcas, and features a complex and robust
          planner object for the use of Sweet Synthesis. Ironically, it is no
          longer written for use in hardcore.

          <strong>phccs</strong> is descended from bean-hccs, but has diverged
          significantly in structure. It is made for <em>very</em> high-greenbox
          accounts. It slices the various CS tests into their own files for
          legibility, and entirely eschews the use of the maximizer in favor of
          preprogrammed outfits, in order to cut down on runtime.

        <p>
          <strong>manny-hccs</strong> uses more daily resources than phccs in
          exchange for higher results. It is noteable for its execution speed,
          consistency, and use of the geneticist lab over the asdon in its
          workshed. It is written in typescript, but was originally forked from
          an ash version of bean-hccs, making it look quite different from its
          forebearer.

          <strong>bb-hccs</strong> is built for much lower-greenbox accounts
          than any of the scripts listed above. It too is a bean-hccs fork, and
          is also no longer written for hardcore! bb-hccs is not currently
          particularly re-entrant–if it throws an error, you may not be able to
          re-start the script. It is an excellent example of how to adapt
          high-iotm scripts for lower-iotm use.

        <p>
          <strong>seventy-hccs</strong> is not descended from bean-hccs, nor is
          it a loop script. Instead, it is designed to do exactly what it says
          on the tin – a 1-day, 70-turn run of the challenge path. Katarn is not
          only the first player to complete a 1/70 run, but he’s also the most
          prolific 1/70 player, and does them often. The design of both diet.ts
          and events.ts are well worth your time, as is the rest of it; because
          seventy-hccs isn’t descended from bean-hccs, just about every part of
          it is going to stand out. If you are going for turncount, there’s no
          better script.

        <p>
          <strong>c2t_hccs</strong> is an actively maintained dedicated ASH
          script for community service designed to be used by a broad group of
          players. It requires a fair amount of setup, detailed in the
          README.md, and one unique aspect of this script is that it works as
          any class. Zdrvst tends to run it as a Seal Clubber which makes it
          valuable for barf farming. It is designed to be appropriately
          re-entrant, and currently terminates before performing any test that
          takes more than one turn, unless configured to do otherwise. If run in
          softcore, it’ll shave about 10 turns off of its expected turncount.

          <strong>LCSWrapper</strong> is not a wrapper and will not farm your
          entire day. Instead, it's a very user-focused .ASH community service
          script, in which the user sets all the preferences and the turncount
          goal. This script supports any class and moon sign in both softcore
          and hardcore, focusing primarily on medium-shiny accounts with ease of
          access to powerleveling tools.

          the VIP &amp; genie bottle, and mortar+weaksauce. It is not
          re-entrant, and it is a 2-day script rather than 1-day (making it
          equally good for karma-farming, but much worse for meat-farming). A

        <p>
          Do not use <strong>autoscend</strong> for community service. Please.
          It is structured around completing the quests the Council gives the
          adventurer in normal paths; while it will do its level best in CS, CS
          support is not an active part of autoscend development. I’m mentioning
          it here both to say that, and to point out the one big leg up
          autoscend has over just about anyone: it has virtually no
          requirements. Autoscend will do its best to fight tooth and nail to
          get you to donate that rockin’ bod to science, and you don’t have to
          even own a genie bottle. If you, for some reason, need to complete a
          community service ascension, have 0 iotms, and 0 ability to play
          turns, sure, fine, use this. But only then, and maybe not even then!
